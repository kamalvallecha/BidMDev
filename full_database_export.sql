Details are given below for your reference:\n\nBackground\nSchneider Electric is a French multinational corporation that specializes in digital automation and energy management. Schneider Electric is interested in running couple of primary market research studies in the Indian market that will enable them to measure and evaluate Schneider Electric’s perception.\n\nIn terms of Product Differentiation, there are immediate competitors for Schneider are Siemens, ABB, EATON, Lauritz Knudsen, etc. In the recent time Schneider witnessed a strong surge of local players who are entering the markets, especially India, and offering product differentiation at a very affordable rate. These players are proving to be a mighty threat in the days to come. Schneider believes in acquisitions of smaller players when there is a lot of scope for innovation.  With regard to these regional players, Schneider Electric is interested in conducting primary market research study on product differentiation where Schneider wants to understand how they can enable further disruption of innovation into their own products and market sentiment. \n\nPrimary objective\nEvaluate Schneider Electric perception vs Top Competitors for the Indian market for the power portfolio (Four pillars: Innovation, Differentiation, Service Delivery, Support). Whether Schneider Electric is innovating enough or is it a matter of them not communicating the innovation enough or they are not paying heed to local competition enough.\n\nProducts in scope\nSchneider Electric(client name only for internal purpose) is looking to drive innovation, differentiation, service delivery and support and looking to collect information for \n-\tACB\n-\tMCCB\n-\tContactors (replace with overload release and MPC BS for this study)\n-\tLV Enclosures\nTarget Audience \n1.\tDistributors (Schneider native distributors and competitor distributors - competitor native as well as multi brand distributors)\n2.\tPanel builders (Type A B C based on revenue.

If the scope changes, pricing may be impacted—could you clarify how this would affect costs and by what amount? Since we need to lock in the exact cost with our client , we prefer to maintain the same pricing for N=45 or fewer. If N = 41+, the CPI will remain the same as quoted. Once the N is lowered to a range of N = 31-40, the CPI will increase to $930. If it is lowered to a range of N = 21 - 30, it will increase to $940.\n\n2.\tAdditionally, the cost for material translation is still pending. Could you confirm the status and include it in the final pricing? Written translation for German, Spanish, Portuguese, and French will be $0.15 per word. For other European languages, it will be $0.22 per word. We will not be able to confirm a price until we know the length and word count. \n\n3.\tRegarding the Sim Translator for Germany and Italy, are you confirming that English-speaking respondents can be recruited in these markets as your previous email not included the cost or mention of these—please clarify. Just to confirm, yes, it is possible that some English-speaking respondents can be recruited in these markets, but we can not predict how many will be English-speaking and how many would prefer their native language. The pricing reflected the need for the Sim Translator for all respondents.\n	0.00	0.00	0.00	\N	\N	\N	f	fixed
