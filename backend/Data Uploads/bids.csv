The potential study would involve a 20-minute online survey targeting three distinct audience segments:
•	Consumer (B2C): Drivers who are responsible for purchasing automotive products, specifically coolant, for their personal vehicles.
•	Retail (B2B2C): Professionals within retail organizations (e.g., petrol stations, DIY shops, auto parts stores, etc) who are responsible for selecting the specific coolant products that will be stocked and sold in their stores. This could include buyers, category managers, or other decision-makers involved in product procurement.
•	Tier 1 & OEMs (B2B): Professionals within Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Tier 1 automotive suppliers who are responsible for selecting the coolant products used in vehicle production.
Sample Size & Geography:
1.	Consumer (B2C): 400 completes per country. We are exploring three country options, based on the top-selling markets for automotive coolant products. We recommend scoping for the following options (countries are TBD at this stage):
a.	Option 1 (7 Countries): Germany, China, Brazil, Mexico, Italy, France, Spain
b.	Option 2 (5 Countries): Germany, China, Brazil, Mexico, Italy
c.	Option 3 (3 Countries): Germany, China, Brazil
2.	Retail (B2B2C): 75 completes per country, using the same country options as the Consumer segment (7, 5, or 3 countries).
3.	Tier 1 & OEMs (B2B): 150 completes globally. Recruitment should focus on securing respondents from leading automotive manufacturers worldwide, rather than being country-specific.
We would appreciate a cost estimate for the following services, broken down by country (where applicable) and audience segment:
•	Survey Scripting
•	Panel Access Fees
•	Recruitment Costs (including incentives)
•	Data Processing

Details are given below for your reference:

Background
Schneider Electric is a French multinational corporation that specializes in digital automation and energy management. Schneider Electric is interested in running couple of primary market research studies in the Indian market that will enable them to measure and evaluate Schneider Electric’s perception.

In terms of Product Differentiation, there are immediate competitors for Schneider are Siemens, ABB, EATON, Lauritz Knudsen, etc. In the recent time Schneider witnessed a strong surge of local players who are entering the markets, especially India, and offering product differentiation at a very affordable rate. These players are proving to be a mighty threat in the days to come. Schneider believes in acquisitions of smaller players when there is a lot of scope for innovation.  With regard to these regional players, Schneider Electric is interested in conducting primary market research study on product differentiation where Schneider wants to understand how they can enable further disruption of innovation into their own products and market sentiment. 

Primary objective
Evaluate Schneider Electric perception vs Top Competitors for the Indian market for the power portfolio (Four pillars: Innovation, Differentiation, Service Delivery, Support). Whether Schneider Electric is innovating enough or is it a matter of them not communicating the innovation enough or they are not paying heed to local competition enough.

Products in scope
Schneider Electric(client name only for internal purpose) is looking to drive innovation, differentiation, service delivery and support and looking to collect information for

2. Length of Interview (LOI)
•	Each interview should be approximately 20 minutes in length.
 
 
3. Sampling Requirement & Methodology
Target Respondents
•	All respondents must be aware of Honda and at least one competitor brand from the target list in their country.
 
Sample Size per Brand
•	Each brand should achieve 400 completed responses per country.
 
Cost-Efficient Quota Approach
•	At the start of the survey, screen for awareness of Honda and all relevant competitor brands.
•	For each respondent, record which brands they are aware of (brand awareness matrix).
•	If a respondent is aware of multiple brands, randomly assign them to fill the quota for multiple eligible brand.
•	Repeat this process until you have 400 completed interviews assigned to each brand in each country.
•	This approach leverages overlapping brand awareness, reducing the total number of unique respondents required and optimizing fieldwork costs.
•	Limit each respondent to filling only one brand quota per country to maintain data integrity.

Request for Quotations
Please provide three separate quotations, corresponding to the following sampling patterns:
1.	Gold: Full coverage (8 countries, 7 brands)
2.	Silver: Medium coverage (5 countries, 7 brands)
